<h2>From our Process' Footprint to Yours</h2>




	<p>
		give & take finds process vital to any project. The following is our process in consideration of our waste output and energy usage. Even though our project believes in a framework of sustainability, we try to be transparent about our process so that from it, we can grow, and from our guide, so can you.

		<h2>Our Process</h2>
		
<p>

	While sometimes can feel like everything we make creates some sort of waste, it's important to remember that there is a balance to creating. We like to start our process in considering our balancing beliefs when it comes to making; three pillars that help guide us in creating consciously.<br><br>
